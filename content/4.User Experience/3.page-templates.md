# Page Templates
We’re going to outline some page structure ideas in templates for you to use when creating pages, based on the content you have. Determine which kind of page aligns most with the content you have, and recreate it in your CMS with the recommended patterns.

## How to determine your page type
Page types allow the user to have a consistent experience across the site, and makes it easier for us to build out pages according to user expectations. The following questions can help you determine which page type you are working with.

**Is the page explaining a service, opportunity, or program from a high-level?**<br>
If yes, you may be looking at a [Landing Page](#landing-page).

**Does the page have child pages living under it?**<br>
If yes, you may be looking at a [Landing Page](#landing-page).

**Does the page have a lot of information to share about one particular topic?**<br>
If yes, you may be looking at a [Detailed Page](#detailed-page).

**Is the page focusing on helping a user accomplish a specific task, or give the user the resources they need to do so?**<br>
If yes, you may be looking at an [Informational Page](#informational-page).

If none of the questions above seem to apply to the page you’re working on, go with the Informational Page template. You may always modify or add to these templates to make them fit user needs better.
