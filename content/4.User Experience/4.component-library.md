# Component Library
We will outline the different kinds of components available on the new site, and how they can be used. Use this library to help decide what components to use after youâ€™ve chosen a page template.

## Types of components
**[Visual components](#visual-components)**<br>
These components rely on imagery to leave an impression on users.

**[Organizational components](#organizational-components)**<br>
These components focus on organizing mostly textual information to make it easy for users to understand information & options.

**[Typographic components](#typographic-components)**<br>
These components focus on prioritizing & presenting text on the page.

**[Connected components](#connected-components)**<br>
These components are all used to share or connect with other content on the site, news, events, and social media.

## How to choose a component
Before adding a component, think about what kind of content you have:

**Do you have access to high quality images or other media?**<br>
If yes, consider using a [visual components](#visual-components) to display this content.

**Do you need to share a variety or group of important information through text?**<br>
If yes, an [organizational components](#organizational-components) would be best to display content in a clear & consistent manner.

**Do you have important announcements or timely information to share through text?**<br>
If yes, consider using a [typographic components](#typographic-components) to ensure this information is highly visible and emphasized.

**Are you looking to link to social media?**<br>
If yes, [connected components](#connected-components) may have the flexibility you need to share links.

**Are you looking to share news or events?**<br>
If yes, some [connected components](#connected-components) allow you to dynamically or manually link to that content.
