# Web Governance Charter

Web governance refers to people, policies, procedures, standards, and guidelines that govern the creation and maintenance of the Monterey Peninsula College official website and digital properties.

The overall goals of Web Governance are to

-   Detail roles, responsibilities, and workflows for creating content and updating the website
    
-   Assist site users in creating digital content that aligns with our brand and engages the site audience(s)
    
-   Maintain consistency and integrity of our website over the long term
    

To that end, this policy outlines the management and governance of our web environment.

## Website Ownership

The day-to-day operation of the website is the responsibility of the **Marketing and Communications Team**. The team understands both the holistic and strategic goals of the website as a marketing tool and implements the technical tactics to achieve those goals.

The Director of Marketing and Communications has the final say on what and how content is put on the website. They will brief the board, president, and other stakeholders as needed about website goals and progress.

The Marketing Specialists are the top liaisons between the team and the rest of the MPC community. 

### Goals:

-   Create and maintain a user experience that is simple, easy to navigate, and user-centric
    
-   Help incoming and current students to find information, support, and complete tasks efficiently
    
-   Maintain integration with other campus systems to optimize processes for admission, registration, and financial aid
    
-   Promote participation in college-sponsored campus and regional events
    
-   Engage alumni and community members in an ongoing relationship with MPC
    
-   Abide by SEO best practices, so information is findable, website performance is optimal, and site usage is lean
    

### Responsibilities:

-   Set website priorities that align with organizational goals
    
-   Analyze progress and learning from past performance
    
-   Understand the entire digital ecosystem, including accessibility for all students
    
-   Communicate clearly and regularly with one another and across the school
    
-   Ensure content and information is accurate, relevant, and up-to-date by monitoring the ticketing system and sending out regular reminders to update content
    

### Evaluation:

-   An annual review will note the yearâ€™s accomplishments and challenges, and identify goals that will be included to work on the following year.

## Centralized Governance
The MPC website follows a centralized governance model. This allows for 
1. Easier management to ensure consistency and alignment with website goals, standards, and guidelines
2. Clear roles and reduced responsibility for employees outside of the Marketing and Communications Team
3. Centralized training and support for all website needs 
4. Streamlined workflows and processes for updating and maintaining the website
