# Copywriting Guidelines
We’re going to point out some writing do’s and don'ts that will help get your creative juices flowing so you can highlight what’s important to your audience in a way they will understand.

## Editorial Style Guide

Style refers to the guidelines that editors and writers follow whenever they refer to persons, places and things; whenever they capitalize, abbreviate, punctuate or spell. Refer to the AP Style Guide for all other guidelines.

### Academic Degrees
General usage: Capitalize a major within a degree or certificate. Use periods when abbreviating type of degree. Spell out the certificate. Examples:
-   Business Administration, A.S.
    
-   Human Services, A.A.S.
    
-   Adolescence Education 7-12: English Concentration, A.A.
    
-   Bookkeeping Certificate
    
-   Industrial Technology: Manufacturing Technology Certificate
    
Capitalize a degree when given in full (before or after the major, or on its own)
    
-   Associate in Science
    
-   Associate of Applied Science

For the partial name of the degree or standing alone, lowercase as follows. <br><br>NOTE no apostrophe, singular: associate degree – NOT associate’s degree
    

### Alumni

When referring to alumni, use the last two digits of their year of graduation, preceded by an apostrophe. In all cases, the degree precedes the year it was awarded.

-   Jane Doe, Music, A.S. ‘24
    
-   John Doe, A.A.S. ‘24
    
Alumna is feminine singular; alumnae is feminine plural; alumnus is masculine and non-gender singular; alumni is masculine and non-gender plural.

Abbreviated versions (alum/alums) may also be substituted for singular/plural.

### Campus Buildings

Capitalize names of campus buildings in full:

-   Prie Research Office
    
-   Modular Village
    
-   Administration Building
    

### Commas

Use the Oxford or serial comma: a comma placed before the final item in a series of three or more items (typically preceding an and, an or, or a nor).

-   Ex. You can access one-on-one support, workshops, or online tools at our tutoring center.
    

### Date & Time

Use cardinal numbers for days of the month — not ordinal. Spell out months in full.

-   November 24, 2024
    
-   Thursday, February 2, 2024
    
-   Nov. 24, 2020
    

Use AM/PM (uppercase, spaces, no periods):

-   Ex. Our hours are 8:30 AM - 4 PM
    

### Departments & Offices

Capitalize full office or department titles, whether or not the office name comes before or after the title.

-   English Department
    
-   Department of Biology
    
-   Admissions Team
    

### Numbers & Numerals

Spell out numbers one through nine.

Always use numerals when referring to someone’s age.

Do not use a numeral to begin a sentence. Spell the number out (or find a way to start the sentence with another word).

### Phone Numbers

Our style is: (XXX) XXX-XXXX

-   Ex. (831) 646-4272
    

### Publications

Italicize names of all print and/or online publications.

-   U.S. News & World Report
    

### Titles

Titles are capitalized when they precede a name but are lowercase when they follow a name or appear in text without a name attached.

-   Dr. Marshall T. Fulbright, III
    
-   President Fullbright
    

## What type of page am I writing/editing?

You’ve already asked this as you consider whether the page is necessary, and what type of page layout you would like. As you consider content, you will find that some of these tips may apply more to you, and others less so. Exercise your best judgment.

Is your page marketing heavy? Or is it more transactional/straightforward?

-   This will likely be the most determining factor in terms of how you frame your content. Even if your page is transactional, you can still frame your content in a way that draws them into the page.
    
-   Always keep the prospective student in mind. How will this page help them? What can they glean about MPC from the content?
    
-   If your page is marketing-heavy, you will likely be leveraging various page display types in some way to organize and market your content appropriately.

## What should I be thinking about when I write?

RELAX! Lots of people say ”I can’t write,” “I’m not a writer,” etc. Nonsense! You are a writer!

Below are some well-understood, logical guidelines and structural tips for writing your content.

### 1.“Why should I care?”
What you are putting online is for our audience. Likely a prospective student. So, write it for them.

-   Tip: Review our personas!
    

-   Speak to your readers. Not at them. Load up on pronouns. “You” (not “students”). “We” (not “the school”).
    
-   Watch your perspective. Steer clear of writing about all of the great things about your office/department/program offers. Write about how the audience (“you”) will benefit from those great things.
    

-   Mission statements (of a certain department or office, etc.) are huge targets for this. That said, incorporate our mission statement into the content. Show, don’t tell. Ex:
     ~~“Our mission statement is…”~~
    “At the student service center, we’ll help you with…”
    

### 2. Devote most of your time to the beginning of your message.
    

Many advertisers come up with dozens of headlines before choosing the right one. You may not be an advertiser, but you need to capture the attention of your audience — and keep it — if you want them to engage with what’s on your page. It’s hard work, but worth it. 
    

 -   We can’t assume readers are going to read everything on the page. Make sure the headlines catch the user's attention, encourage them to continue reading, and are informative enough to help the user scan the page.
    
 -   If you are writing a transactional and straightforward page, your headline will probably not be too catchy. BUT — you can always write in a tone that aligns with the brand.
    

### 3. Tell our story.
Why stories? 
    

 - They show, don’t tell. It’s one thing for you to say you help students. It’s better to hear it from a real person who benefitted from your services.
    

-   They are human. MPC serves people! People can see themselves in other students/alumni stories
    

-   They are original. Nobody else can tell the stories of your students, faculty, & alumni
    

What is a story?
Here is nearly every story you see or hear in a nutshell:
    

-   A **CHARACTER** who wants something encounters a **PROBLEM** before they can get it. At the peak of their despair, a **GUIDE** steps into their lives, and **CALLS THEM TO ACTION**. That action helps them **AVOID FAILURE**, and ends in **SUCCESS**.
    
-   Audience = CHARACTER
    
-   MPC = GUIDE
    
Help our audience avoid failure, succeed, and call them to action by including buttons, driving them deeper/around the website, and encouraging them to contact you.
    

-   MPC offers a lot of great programs. So do other schools/departments. What makes OURS better?
    

-   What is unique about your program, or how your office/department operates that will make readers stop and read?
    
-   What outcomes can they expect?
    
-   This applies to written copy, quotes, images, etc.
    

### 4. Make your copy clear and easy to follow.
    

-   Be conversational! Be bold! Speak the language of our audience.
    

-   Use bullet points/lists.
    
-   Use short sentences. And short paragraphs.
    
-   Check your readability level: [HemingwayApp](https://hemingwayapp.com/) is free.
    

-   Suggested reading level: 9th grade. There will be many pages that are more technical and detailed - EG, policies and procedures, specific processes that need to be followed, etc. Aim for the 9th grade with higher-level pages where you are speaking to a broad audience.
    

### 5. Other tips:
    

-   Don’t be afraid to borrow. (Not steal). Much of the world’s best content is inspired by others. How can you use content from another department, or a competitor, and make it your own by adding your unique value for the reader, working in your voice, etc?
    
-   Avoid adverbs and passive language.
    
    
-   Use strong verbs. (realize vs. find, cultivate vs. form)
    
    
-   It’s OK to break grammar and academia writing rules (sometimes). See: being conversational. Contractions are OK. Start a sentence with and, but or because. Sentence fragments. Sometimes they add emphasis. Sometimes. Not all the time.
    
-   Write a first draft and come back to it later with a fresh set of critical eyes.
