# Multimedia Best Practices
Learn how to invoke the MPC brand in the visuals and imagery across the site.
## How important is multimedia?

Multimedia content is a key display type in the MPC visual language. Prospective students prefer multimedia content that is:

-   Authentic
    
-   Concise
    
-   Visual
    
-   Peer-approved
    
-   Purpose-driven
    
-   Mobile-friendly
    

  

## What makes a photo/video “on-brand” for MPC?

MPC photography should fall in line with the success criteria for the brand:

-   Convey the supportive, success-oriented nature of MPC
    
-   Convey a comfortable and supportive sense of home
    
-   Highlight the value of an MPC education as a soft launching pad that helps students succeed and prepares them for the next steps in education or career
    
-   Support a mobile-friendly web experience that considers users with varying bandwidth access
    

Every effort should be made to ensure photography and video aligns with MPC brand voice. Photography and videography should have an authentic feel, use rich color, and support MPC brand identity and key messages, which focus on the following:

1.  Excellent Education
    
2.  Completion Culture
    
3.  Innovative Environment
    
4.  Campus Community

### Style Notes: General Qualities

All photography, regardless of subject and distance, should share the following qualities:

-   Be well-lit – Having adequate brightness and contrast
    
-   Be authentic – Relying on non-posed scenes with genuine expressions
    
-   Have dynamic angles – Leaning into asymmetry and interesting points of view
    
-   Use a journalistic lens - the viewer should feel invested in the subject
    

#### Portraits

PURPOSE: Highlight the strength and personality of individuals

-   Pair these with quotes or bios
    
-   Nonbusy backgrounds – To keep the attention on the subject’s face
    

-   Choose simple backgrounds when possible – uncluttered walls, foliage
    
-   Shallow depth of field – blur out irrelevant details
    

-   Genuine expression – Ensure faces convey genuine emotion – pride, happiness, determination. Avoid blank expressions and “fake” smiles.
    
-   Cropped just below the shoulders

#### Situations

PURPOSE: Show off how learning and interaction work at MPC.

-   Include the environment if it contributes to understanding the subject – for example, a lab, classroom, or street scene
    
-   Invite the viewer into the scene – have a strong focal point and avoid too many backs of people

-   Local landmarks, street scenes, and hot spots
    
-   Highlight the innovative environment

#### Objects

Used to symbolically represent subject matter and give a future-focused appearance

-   Use occasionally
    
-   Stock is okay– used selectively
    
-   Avoid cliches (examples: a gavel or beaker for “science”, dollar bills for “money”)

### Incorrect Usages

AVOID Abstract, impersonal illustrations in place of custom images.

AVOID Overly filtered/stylized shots. Especially images that flatten the content using cool-toned filters.

AVOID Extreme angles and stylized lens techniques (such as fish eye, zoom, and blur).

AVOID Overlaying distracting graphics/text. These are bad for SEO and accessibility.

## Shot Recommendations

Based on the Designed Screens and Sitemap, the following is a list of recommended shots for populating the website:

 

### Campus Photography

Campus photos play an important role in giving students the context of their surroundings. Photographers should capture a good balance of simple, establishing shots and more personal shots displaying bustling student life.

**Campuses**

-   Photos with and without campus signage.
    
-   Large groups of students walking around the campuses:
    

-   Shots capturing the motion on campus: students commuting from place to place.
    

-   Smaller groups of students and individuals with recognizable campus features in the background.
    
-   Exterior shots of important facilities on each campus. Capture a range of facilities that are academically significant and can be used on program-specific pages.
    
-   Campuses in different seasons/decorated for specific holidays.
    

**Amenities**

-   Show off MPC amenities in an engaging way. It may be useful to photograph facilities in a plain, establishing way, but also show them in use. Add human subjects to these shots as well as showing multiple subjects interacting.
    

-   Housing
    
-   Health and Safety
    
-   Offices and Faculty
    
-   Fitness Centers
    
-   Libraries
    

**Local Culture**

-   The campuses aren’t the only part of MPC story. The local area have a large influence over the culture. Photographers should capture the essence of the local culture and show what a beautiful place Monterey County is to learn, work, and live. These images can be used on the About and Visit pages.
    

  

### Student Life

Show off the student life by using an intimate, personal lens. Get up close and personal with students in their natural environment. Student features are not only a great way to highlight a unique story of success, but demonstrate how others can follow in their footsteps. These vignettes can act as a vehicle for showing the impact of certain clubs, programs, mentors, and facilities on campus.

-   Ideally, the students whose stories are being highlighted are the same ones being photographed for the website.
    

-   The viewer should feel like they’re getting an inside look at this student’s life on campus.
    
-   Photographers should capture a good mix of posed portraits and shots of the student in action. Depending on what is being highlighted, either of these could be useful.
    

-   Student stories are a great way to add a personal touch to other information across the site. When gathering stories, keep in mind how they might add substance to the following:
    

-   Pathways of study (e.g. different types of students and applicants)
    
-   Program information (e.g. a story highlighting the Biology program and how a student took advantage of MPC resources)
    
-   Clubs and organizations (e.g. the president of a student organization)
    
-   Faculty (e.g. how a student was inspired and mentored by a faculty member)
    
-   Facilities (e.g. a student who took advantage of creative space on campus to create a work of art)
    
-   Athletics (e.g. how a student balances their academic and athletic interests)
    

  

### Faculty and Alumni

When gathering photographs of faculty members and alumni, treat them similarly to students by humanizing them and showing them in a social context. These photos should build upon the MPC community image, how do you want to come across to those who don’t know you? Showing a welcoming, diverse cast of characters that allows viewers to create a personal connection.

As well as gathering posed portraits, photographers should show faculty supporting students:
    

-   Tutoring Services
    
-   Academic Advising
    
-   Skills Development Resources
    
-   Disability Services
    

Building out the community image by showing Alumni stories and the possibilities that await after an MPC education.
    

These can be used in tandem with program information in order to demonstrate how students could use their degree in the future.
    

  

### Program Highlights

Academic programs are the “products” you offer. As such, we recommend that your Program Detail pages are engaging and visually appealing, highlighting the experiences students will have while studying at MPC .

-   In addition to one hero image, we recommend at least one more photo per program. More may be needed if a program has more to offer. Images may come in the form of a student or faculty story, a carousel, in the WYSIWYG editor, or any other component.
    

-   The Hero image should not be too visually overwhelming since there will be text placed on top of it. Avoid busy computer screens, faces getting overlapped by text, and nondescript placeholder imagery.
    

-   Gathering a wide range of generic shots of programs can provide content for other pages across the site. A lot of topics on the site do not yield visually interesting photo opportunities, so photographers should create a repository of program images to accurately represent the student experience. The following topics would benefit from supplemental program imagery:
    

	-   Registration
    
	-   Applications and Admissions
    
	-   Online Programming
    
	-   Program Catalogs
    
	-   Testing and Placement
    
	-   Workforce Development
    
	-   Fees and Financial Aid
    
	-   Academic Support
    

  

### News and Events

News stories should be populated with an appropriate image. As these swap out for new stories, ensure that all featured articles and events have an accompanying image. This may be a big lift since there are a lot of existing articles and upcoming events, so employ stock imagery here if necessary.

### Image Sizes
Follow these sizing requirements to optimize the designs and display of imagery.

## Videos: Best Practices

MPC  already has some quality videos on its YouTube channel and across the site but many of the videos are outdated. Whether you’re choosing from existing video assets or creating from scratch, keep the following guidelines top of mind.

### Keep it real

Diverse. User-generated. Under the hood.

Staged photos and videos won’t pass the sniff test. Prospective students don’t want to be sold to. They want to be understood and respected. They want to be spoken to like adults. They want to see themselves in someone else.

1.  Featured MPC students, faculty, & alumni should feel confident, direct, and successful.
    
2.  Focus on polished ‘real talk’: overcoming obstacles, and achieving goals
    
3.  Keep the visual fabric rich
    
4.  Allow groups to bring natural energy to the conversation
    
5.  Consider user-generated content (with permission)
    

  

### Make it snappy

Short. Timely. Layered context.

Prospective students are impatient. They want to get as much information as possible as quickly as possible. Value their time by focusing on what’s really important.

1.  Focus on snackable video content. 1-2 minutes is ideal. No mini-lectures
    
2.  Use simple captions to provide additional context and to add a layer of MPC branding and voices
    

### YouTube has SEO, too!

The internet’s second-largest search engine!

Beyond hosting your videos on YouTube and embedding them onto your site, YouTube is an extremely powerful search tool.

Leverage your keyword research and insert keywords into appropriate YouTube metadata AND the video itself.

1.  SAY the keyword in the video
    
2.  Include keywords in video title, description, & tags
    
3.  Leverage hashtags to drive traffic to videos
